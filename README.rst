Simple artifact versioning and caching for scientific workflows


* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://pyrepro.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------

`pyrepro` exists to provide a simple interface for versioning functions that produce artifacts.
An "artifact" could be anything -- maybe you have some sort of ETL pipeline that writes intermediate files,
or you have a plotting function that writes a bunch of plots to disk, or you have a machine learning
workflow that produces a bunch of model files somewhere. The purpose of `pyrepro` is to allow you
to write normally -- give your output its regular name, like `plot.png` -- and automatically attach
git commit and configuration information as part of the path.

Example
-------

The following example shows how to use `pyrepro` to tag an output file with commit and config info:

    from pyrepro import Artifact

    @Artifact(keyword='outpath', config={}, allow_dirty=True)
    def save_thing(outpath):
        with open(outpath, 'w') as outf:
            outf.write('good job')
